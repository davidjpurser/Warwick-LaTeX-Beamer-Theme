This is an *unofficial* LaTeX Beamer theme modelled roughly after the website of the University of Warwick.
See [some of my slides][example] for a demo.

To use it place the `wwlogo.png` and `.sty` and the files where latex can find them and include
`\usetheme{Warwick}` in your preamble.

You can use the colour theme separately in combination with other themes
via `\usecolortheme{Warwick}`.

If you know how to improve things, don't hesitate and fork away!
