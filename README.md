This is an *unofficial* LaTeX Beamer theme modelled roughly after the website of the University of Warwick.

It is heavily extended from [a theme by Patrick Totzke][from]

See `example-pres.pdf` for a demo.

To use it place the `logo-with-descriptor.pdf` and `.sty` and the files where latex can find them and include
`\usetheme{Warwick}` in your preamble.


It has several options:

`\usetheme[style=blue,external]{Warwick}`

* `externalfront` shows 'The University of Warwick' below 'Warwick' only on the title page.
* `external` shows 'The University of Warwick' below 'Warwick'. (Using both behaves as `external`).
* `style` is one of `aubergine,blue,ruby,orange,gold`. Default is blue.
